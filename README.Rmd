# ncaam_coaches

Working repo for exploring select ncaa men's basketball coaches data.

## Data gathering
- html table scraping using rvest as outlined here (https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-rvest-to-scrape-an-html-table/).
- update input_data_table.csv file with additional coaches data. 

## Trouble with git?
- for files that don't need to be tracked, add them to .gitignore
- if already pushed to remote repo, run the following and push as outlined here (https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues/122): git rm --cached file_name
