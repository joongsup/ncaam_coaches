==============

Working repo for exploring select ncaa men's basketball coaches data.

Data gathering
--------------

-   html table scraping using rvest as outlined here (<https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-rvest-to-scrape-an-html-table/>).
-   update input\_data\_table.csv file with additional coaches data.

Trouble with git?
-----------------

-   for files that don't need to be tracked, add them to .gitignore
-   if already pushed to remote repo, run the following and push as outlined here (<https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues/122>): git rm --cached file\_name
